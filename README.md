# MonsterRush
A tower defense webgame, developed with Unity3D.

1.Project objectives
Our Objective was to build a website with a Tower Defense game. Which is fun and entreating for the players. The main objective of the game is to kill the monsters who come to attack the Castle through building new towers which can shoot bullets to attack the monsters coming in their shooting radius. As long as your Castle are safe from the monsters you wonâ€™t lose the game. We create simple 3D models (environments and characters of the game) in Unity3D which is a game engine. We also store the data of the web game which can be use in the next time the player logins and displaying to player, for example, the score and the gold amount from the last time the player quitted the game. The web game allows player to sign up and login, so they can keep their score and gold, and continue in the next play. Finally, we use cloud service to publish our website on the Internet.
Tower defense is a subgenre of strategy video game where the goal is to defend a player's territories or possessions by obstructing the enemy attackers, usually achieved by placing defensive structures on or along their path of attack.

2.Features implemented
(1)3D environment and characters of the game.
(2)Login system for player to sign up and login, to keep their score and gold, and continue in the next play.
(3)Scoring system accumulates score each time the player eliminates a monster.
(4)High scores ranking list which stores the scores that the player reached in every game and ranks them.
(5)Resource system collect gold each time the player eliminates a monster.
(6)Store in which player can buy different towers with different attack damages.
(7)Automatic navigation system of the monsters which allows the monsters to find the Castle and carry out attacks.


3.Features planned but not implemented
(1)Different monsters with different powers.
(2)Different bullets with different attack damages
(3)Different levels of different difficulties in the game.
We did not implement these features because they will take lots of time to do 3D modeling and programming, and we have time constraint for this project.

4.Potential improvements
(1)Implement the features planned but not implemented above
(2)The 3D environment and characters of the game can be more beautiful and complex, detailed.
(3)The game can have more complex and scary animations.
(4)Improve the algorithms/codes to make the web game more efficient to save the transmitting /computing time and resources

5.Framework and technologies adopted
We use C# to program the game in a game engine called Unity3D. 3D modeling is also done in Unity3D, and we use the graphics editor called Adobe Photoshop to make the textures for the 3D models. To build the website for the web game, we need to use an API called WebGL (Web Graphics Library), which can be done in Unity3D. Our version control is archived by Github. We use the website hosting service called SiteGround and Cpanel to publish our website, the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is also used to transfer the files of for published website to Cpanel.
